# Standalone Command Line

Moco can be used as standalone to run with configuration and you can download standalone directly:
[Standalone Moco Runner](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/dreamhead/moco-runner/0.11.0/moco-runner-0.11.0-standalone.jar)

First of all, a JSON configuration file needs to be provided to start Moco.

```json
[
  {
    "response" :
      {
        "text" : "foo"
      }
  }
]
```
(foo.json)

## Server Type

A server type is a must for Moco, you need specify your server type as first argument. Different server type will support different arguments.

### HTTP Server

You can start a HTTP server by the following command:

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -p 12306 -c foo.json
```

### HTTPS Server

A HTTPS server can be started by the following command:

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar https -p 12306 -c foo.json --https /path/to/cert.jks --cert mocohttps --keystore mocohttps
```

### Socket Server

A socket server can be started by the following command:

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar socket -p 12306 -c foo.json
```

## Port

If you don't need any specified port, you run run Moco without port.

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -c foo.json
```

An available port will picked up by Moco and you can see the port in console.

```shell
20 Oct 2015 22:10:18 [main] INFO  Server is started at 58593
20 Oct 2015 22:10:18 [main] INFO  Shutdown port is 58594
```

## Version

You can query Moco version by the following command: 

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar version
```

## Global Settings

You can run Moco instance with [global settings](global-settings.md).

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -p 12306 -g settings.json
```

### Environment

[Environment](global-settings.md#environment) is a good feature, which allows you start your server with different environment from CLI.

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -p 12306 -g env.json -e remote
```

## Shutdown

Moco instance can ben shutdown by shutdown command and its shutdown port. A shutdown port can be specified when start Moco instance.

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -p 12306 -c foo.json -s 9527
```

Or leave Moco to choose by default, the shutdown port will be shown on console.

Then you can use the shutdown port to shutdown the running Moco instance.

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar shutdown -s 9527
```

## Watch Service

Moco use monitor from commons-io to monitor file changes by default. You can change to WatchService API by adding `--watch-service` argument.

The `--watch-service` argument works with `http`, `https` and `socket` server types:

```shell
java -jar moco-runner-<version>-standalone.jar http -p 12306 -c foo.json --watch-service
```

The WatchService API provide better performance and less compatibility. A known issue is that it won't work on Docker Toolbox above Win 7.
